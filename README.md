## Getting Started 🔥

Setting up an LLM server requires just three steps:

1. Get an API key for a Google Cloud service account
2. Deploy Haven's manager container on a Google Cloud instance
3. Spin up a model worker using the Python SDK

A description of these steps can be found in our [documentation](https://docs-havenhq.vercel.app/).
